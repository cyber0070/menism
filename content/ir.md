Iâ€™m a Linux enthusiast. I use a GNU+Linux distribution called **Debian Linux**. Yeah no, Iâ€™m not an arch/gentoo fanboi, I just love using the debian as it fits my needs. I also use a window manager called i3 instead of using a desktop environment(been using i3 for about 3 years now, ainâ€™t gonna change anytime soon).

I started coding at grade 11 (11th standard in Indian terms). For me, I was attracted to computers by technology and computer from my childhood and during the COVID-19 lockdown when everything was completely shut off, where I developed interest towards **Linux, Development, AI** And **Higher Mathematics**.
